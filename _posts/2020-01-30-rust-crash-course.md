Learn the basics of Rust and how it guarantees safe code.

Rust is a new and fairly unique programming language in that it is a
systems-level language that can guarantee both memory safety *and* thread
safety. It does this by designing it's syntax to make it possible for the Rust
compiler to detect issues such as memory leaks, segmentation faults, dangling
pointers, deadlocks, and race conditions; and prevent these issues from making
it into the final build.

You should learn Rust. It's cool.
