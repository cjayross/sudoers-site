            </a> (OS) is software that is responsible for managing how programs access and utilize hardware such as the CPU.<br><br>
            This limits the compatibility of programs between OS's since they may not share the same features or restrictions.<br><br>
            Overall this means that different operating systems often result in different user experiences.
