An introduction to the basics of quantum computing.

Quantum computing is the study of information in quantum states and how this
information can be implemented into algorithms using quantum circuits. It's a
beautiful and exciting field, but one that is nonetheless burdened by a high
barrier to entry. The goal of this talk is to prove to you that you may
actually understand more than you'd think about this subject.

*Note:* No jokes about Schr√∂dinger's cat will be tolerated.
