        <h2>refs</h2>
        <div>
            <p>ref is short for reference</p>
            <p>A ref is kind of like an alias for a commit</p>
            <p>Just like anything else in Linux, a ref is actually a file</p>
            <p>You can find each ref in the <code>.git</code> directory</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Joke: it's almost as if Linux and git were made by the same person.</aside>

        <h2>refs</h2>
        <div>
            <p>a <b>branch</b> is actually just a ref</p>
            <p>a <b>tag</b> is actually just a ref</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>refs</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Many of you have probably interacted with HEAD</p>
            <p>HEAD is actually just a (special) ref!</p>
        </div>
        <section>
            <h2>Wait. What's a tag?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>It's basically just a <b>fancy alias for a commit</b></p>
                <p>Project maintainers often tag the last commit of a version</p>
                <p><code>git tag v1.0.1</code></p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Wait. What's HEAD?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>It's basically just a fancy alias for the <b>most recent commit</b></p>
                <p><code>git reset HEAD</code> will reset back to the most recent commit</p>
            </div>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>refs: opening the hood</h2>
        <div>
            <p>You can look at what a ref is pointing to with <code>git rev-parse insert-ref-here</code></p>
            <p>You can look at what's in that commit with <code>git show insert-ref-here</code></p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Demo it!</aside>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>refs: opening the hood</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Since refs are just plain text files, you can read them with a text editor</p>
            <p>You may see</p>
            <ul>
                <li>refs: path/to/other/ref</li>
                <li>A commit hash</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Words hash and SHA are used interchangeably. You might see more than one ref if packing is involved. We'll talk about that later. Mention refs may have been put in .git/packed-refs. Demo it!</aside>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>refs: sticking your hand in the engine</h2>
        <div>
            <p>You can manually modify and create refs by editing files in <code>.git/</code></p>
            <p>Don't do this in any repos you actually care about</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Create PP ref. Show how you can use refs/heads/branch-name. Checkout into a ref.</aside>

        <h2>Git objects!</h2>

        <h2>Types of git objects</h2>
        <div align="left">
            <p>Commit objects</p>
            <p>Tree objects</p>
            <p>Blob objects</p>
        </div>

    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Commit objects</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This contains the metadata of the commit and points to a tree object</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Show with git cat-file -p.</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Tree objects</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Trees can have other trees and/or blobs as children. They represent directories.</p>
            <img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/data-model-1.png">
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">Use the word "point" just like in the last slide. Show with git cat-file -p</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Blob objects</h2>
        <div>
            <p>These contain the (compressed) contents of a file being tracked</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">The Pro Git book describes git as a "content-addressable filesystem." Git is very good at storing files as a key-value pair with the hash of the file as the key and the file's contents as the value. Git does not actually store deltas. It actually just stores the files as you've written them.</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Here's what the object graph looks like</h2>
        <div>

     <section>
        <h2>reflog</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The reflog keeps track of almost everything you do with refs</p>
            <p>You can see the history with <code>git reflog</code></p>
            <p>You can go back in time by checking out objects and refs from the reflog</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">(Almost) nothing is truly gone! Don't forget to demo it!</aside>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
        <div>
            <p>The garbage collector helps conserve disk space</p>
            <p>Git has a garbage collector which will remove unused objects, prune the reflog and move refs into the file .git/packed-refs</p>
            <p>Many of git's commands will automatically invoke the garbage collector</p>
            <p>The garbage collector can be run manually with <code>git gc</code></p>
            <p>Warning: now there's actually no going back</p>
        </div>
        <aside class="notes">As previously mentioned, objects are already compressed using zlib. You do not need to use this often. If time allows, talk about removing initial commit by deleting branch ref</aside>

        <h2>To sum it all up</h2>
        <div>
            <p>refs can point to other refs or commit objects</p>
            <p>commit objects can point to other commit objects and trees</p>
            <p>tree objects can point to other trees or blobs</p>
            <p>blob objects contain the contents of the files in the git repository</p>
        </div>
